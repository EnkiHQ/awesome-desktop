"""Best-effort diagnostics for support requests (``diag.log`` in the runtime directory).

Players report problems such as multi-monitor misplacement or clicks that do
nothing. This log records the facts needed to reproduce them (monitor layout,
DPI awareness of the Explorer windows, icon counts, what blocks the mouse). It
never raises: diagnostics must not break the game.
